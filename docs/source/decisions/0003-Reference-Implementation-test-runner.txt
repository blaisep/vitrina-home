===================================================
Which test runner for the reference implementation
===================================================

Status
======

Discussing

Context
=======

The reference implementation should provide the rudimentary characteristics of a typical web app infrastructure, so that a dev can have a working example they can modify.


Primary guiding principles
==========================

- Provide a working minimumum viable reference
- Clear, public interfaces to facilitate modification.
-

Decision
========

If our goal is to be as portable as possible, there are a few ways we could go:
    1- Issue assertions using the common posix tools (ifconfig, nslookup, curl)
    2- provide a all-in-one python script that would mock and test each feature.
    3- Use a test runner like pytest  or Robot Framework and include a list of fixtures and modules.


Python tools
============

pyinfra
    `A python package`_ for provisioning infrastructure using classes called "operations."

testinfra
    `A python library`_ for testing infrastructure https://github.com/Fizzadar/pyinfra/blob/2.x/tests/end-to-end/test_e2e_local.py

ansible-facts
    The Ansible core module will collect facts about a host and return those as fields. Only works on a single host at a time.

All-in-One
==========

    - Localstack: `a mock AWS infrastructure <https://github.com/localstack/localstack>`_ a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container


Test runner
============

    - Pytest

    - Robot Framework
