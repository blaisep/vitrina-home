===============================
Architechtural Decision records
===============================


An architectural decision record (:term:`ADR`) is a set of facts describing the items we take into consideration when we choose to do one thing and not another.
Just as linking the requirement (``feature``) to the implementation (``steps``) is an evolutionary process, so is noting when we make a decision.
I wonder if there is a way to associate scenarios (or other objects) with decision records
