============
Taking Notes
============

Natural sciences are opinionated about keeping a lab notebook, often prohibiting students from using pencils to discourage mutation (ahem).
Vitrina suggests looking for the equivalent in software, an opinionated method to
* conserve all user input (shell commands, URLs)
* save all my results (console output, results, error logs)
* conserve all my references (links to diagrams, API definitions, etc)
* support cross-reference or dynamic links to other sources (eg. avoid retyping or copy/paste)

Re-use immutable content
========================

A number of methods (eg. diataxis) suggests four kinds of documents:
    * Howto
    * Descriptions
    * References
    * Changes

To these four, we add two more for the control plane:
    * Automation (orchestration, dependencies)
    * Instrumentation (logs, metrics)

For example the project blog is based on a text file which serves as the input collector.
From there, content will make its way into several categories.
